Today we are happy to be joined by Michelle Piccinini from New American Funding who is going to talk a little bit about interest rates and some new mortgage options for potential homebuyers out there.

As far as interest rates are concerned, we are seeing more of the same. Last week, more money started coming into bonds, which helped rates. **It was not a dramatic change, but it did help**. Rates still remain around 4.5%. They are not in the 3% or low 4% range anymore, so I do not believe anyone who tells you that.

Finally, Michelle and New American Funding are offering some great new mortgage products. **They have some Non-Qualified Mortgages which can allow those who have been through a bankruptcy or foreclosure to buy a home after two years instead of the typical seven.** As long as you have money down, good credit, and a stable income, they can get you another loan a whole lot quicker.

Teaser: Our friend Michelle Piccinini joined us recently to give us the latest mortgage news. Interest rates are remaining steady around 4.5%, and we are no longer seeing them in the 3% range. Michelle and her team at New American Funding also have a few unique options for homeowners who have gone through distressed sales. Typically, you have to wait seven years after a foreclosure to buy another home. With their mortgage products, you can purchase another home in just two years. To learn more, watch this short video.
