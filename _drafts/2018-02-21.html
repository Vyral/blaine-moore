Here are a few of the recent changes to the tax code that could have a big impact on Nevada homeowners in the days, months, and years to come. It’s important that you know about these changes now so that you don’t make any missteps:<br /><br />1. The standard deduction has increased. For single filers, it’s up to $12,000. For joint filers, it’s $24,000. For those of you who have been itemizing deductions, it might make more sense for you to just take the standard deduction now.<br /><br />2. The mortgage interest write-off is capped at $750,000. If you purchased a home before December 14, however, you will be grandfathered in at the $1 million cap. Moving forward, however, you can only deduct mortgage interest up to $750,000.<br /><br />3. State and local taxes. These are going to be capped at $10,000. You won’t be able to claim more than that.<br /><br />4. Capital gains fees. For joint filers, that’s $500,000. For single filers, it’s $250,000. Remember, you have to have lived in the home for two of the last five years to claim this deduction.<br /><br />If you have any questions for us about these changes or about anything else relating to real estate, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><div><br /></div>
