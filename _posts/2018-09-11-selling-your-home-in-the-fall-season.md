There are three reasons why it’s a good idea to sell your home in the fall:

**- Buyers are more serious.** Buyers looking for homes in the fall didn’t find their perfect home during the summer, so they’re probably more motivated to find them before winter and the holidays arrive, and possibly to take advantage of the tax benefits they’ll get if they buy before the end of the year.

**- You’ll have less competition.** It’s no secret that more homes come on the market in the spring and summer than at the end of the year. Homes that didn’t sell during the summer will be taken off the market, which means you’ll have fewer homes to compete with, allowing you to stand out to buyers and sell your home faster.

**- You’ll have the opportunity to move up into a larger home.** Sellers during this time of year will likely be more eager to sell their homes, and with the reduced competition, you’ll be able to purchase a home and sell your own readily.
