Here’s what you can expect from the Reno market this fall whether you’re buying or selling.

Our market typically peaks in July and August, and 2017 was no different. Right now, the Reno market is starting to slow down. **Here’s what that means for buyers and sellers.**

For sellers, it means that you’ll have much less competition if you list your home this fall than if you would have listed in the summer. This makes it more likely you’ll receive more (and higher) offers from potential buyers. As far as buyers are concerned, the low inventory is going to make things competitive.

In July, we sold over 600 homes. However, last October we sold 550. As you can see, there is still plenty of activity in the market during fall. **If you’re thinking about buying or selling a Reno home in the next few months, there’s a great opportunity out there** for you to do that.

If you have any questions for me or you’re interested in buying or selling a Reno home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
