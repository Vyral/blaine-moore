New American Funding has just announced an amazing new home loan option designed for first-time homebuyers in the Reno area who don't have as much money for a down payment as they'd like.

New American Funding has a new home buying program hot off the press that we wanted to share with you today. This program is designed for first-time homebuyers and those who need some help with a down payment.

**The program is a 1% down option for first-time homebuyers here in the Reno area.**

Fannie Mae requires a 3% minimum, so what we love about this program is that New American Funding is actually offering a 2% grant to offset the requirement.

This is an amazing option for first-time homebuyers who don't have the savings for a down payment currently or don't qualify in a home buying threshold that they want to. It's also a great opportunity for those who want to take advantage of this great market and are excited to buy a home.

There are some income limitations so that they can assure the program is tailored to those who truly need the assistance.

If you're interested or just want to learn a little bit more about this loan option, give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to tell you more!
