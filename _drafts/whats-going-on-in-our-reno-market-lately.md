What’s going on in our reno market lately?

According to Michelle Piccinini of New American Funding, because there’s so much positivity in this market, **we’ve seen an increase in buying power and home equity.** We’re not back to where we were in 2004, but we’re seeing a lot more second liens and home equity lines of credit (aka HELOC).

Michelle is still a little leery of home equity lines of credit, but only because they aren’t a fixed option. Whenever the Federal Reserve talks about raising interest rates, they’re talking about raising the prime rate, which impacts short-term loans. Essentially, that’s what a second lien is, which is why they can be risky.

The good news is **we’re also seeing fixed liens coming back into the game.** If you’re in the $600,000 to $700,000 price point and don’t have the down payment necessary for a jumbo loan, you can now get a first lien, pair it with a fixed second lien, and still have a secure payment that won’t change on you and still gives you the buying power you need to be competitive in this market.

If you’re thinking about getting a home equity line of credit, talk it over with your bank or lender first.

If you have any more questions for Michelle, you can call her at (775) 501-8546. If you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
